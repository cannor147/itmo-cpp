# C++ Language

Course was designed and taught by [Ivan Sorokin](https://github.com/sorokin) at ITMO University in 2018 (year2017, 2ndâ€“3rd semesters).

## Theory

### 1st semester

1. Introduction to registers and assembler
2. Computer architecture
3. Basics of C++
4. Program compilation process
5. Structures and classes
6. Inheritance and virtual functions
7. Security and exceptions
8. Memory model in C++
9. Templates
10. Undefined Behaviour
11. STL
12. `namespace` & ADL

### 2nd semester

13. Intrusive containers. Heterogeneous lookup. `shared_ptr` & `weak_ptr`.
14. Rvalue references
15. Lamda calculus in C++
16. `std::signal` and reentrancy
17. Type operations in C++
18. Multithreading in C++
19. Asynchronous execution
20. Ranges
21. Corrutines in C++
22. Unicode support
23. Work with File System

## Homeworks

### 1st semester

1. Arithmetics with assembler: statements is stored locally, solution has been lost
2. `big_integer` ([statements (ru) and solution](https://github.com/cannor147/itmo-cpp-bigint))
3. Small Object & Copy-on-Write optimizations ([statements (ru) and solution](https://github.com/cannor147/itmo-cpp-bigint) together with `big_integer`)
4. Huffman's algorithm ([statements (ru) and solution](https://github.com/cannor147/itmo-cpp-huffman))

### 2nd semester

5. Search files by substring ([statements (ru) and solution](https://github.com/cannor147/itmo-cpp-substr))
6. Search for duplicate files ([statements (ru) and solution](https://github.com/cannor147/itmo-cpp-duplicate))

## Exam works

### 1st semester

- `set_restore_guard`: [statements (ru) and solution](https://github.com/cannor147/itmo-cpp-restore)
- `sequence`: [statements (ru) and solution](https://github.com/cannor147/itmo-cpp-sequence)

### 2nd semester

- `intrusive_ptr`: statements is stored locally, solution has been lost
